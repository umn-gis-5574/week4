## Projects and introducing CartoDB



1. Quick introductions of projects, if the suggesters are interested in working with others. 

    - **See the projects here:**

2. Discuss projects and any others that came up. We'll hold off on "choosing" a project until next week.
3. CartoDB introduction and assignment.
    - [Sign up for CartoDB using this link](https://cartodb.com/signup?plan=academy)
    - Complete [*Online Mapping for Beginners*](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/01-beginners-course.html), and [*CartoDB.js*](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/03-cartodbjs-ground-up.html)
    - Create a table and map on CartoDB using a dataset of your own or that you find somewhere.
    - Post a link to your map as an [Issue](https://github.com/umn-gis-5574/week4/issues) on this repository.

**Note:** If you've already done some work with CartoDB and this stuff is too easy for you, that's fine. In that case I'd like you to complete one or two of the other academy courses, or a few of the tougher tutorials.
